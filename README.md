# Totally Overkill Startup Optimizations

A very simple and totally overkill startup optimization script. Either run the script when you feel like cleaning up your computer or go the extra mile and automatically run it when your computer starts up.

## ⚙️ Installation

* Install Python
* Download `toso.py` or `toso-extended.py`
* Edit the file to add the file paths that you want to clean
* Right click on the file
* Left click on `Create shortcut`
* Press `WIN + R` and type `shell:startup`
* After pressing enter, paste the shortcut in the directory that popped up
* You're all set ! Anytime your computer boots up it will cleanup the specified folders and ask for administrator priviledges so it can run the system file and hard drive verifications if you chose the extended version
