Just a simple and totally overkill startup optimization script, either launch the script when you feel like it or follow the steps bellow to make it automatically run when your computer boots up.

Follow either of these options they both give the same result :

- paste the script somewhere on your computer, create a shortcut, press WIN + R, type `shell:startup`, and paste the shortcut in the directory that popped up
or
- paste the script somewhere on your computer, create a shortcut, and place that shortcut in `C:\Users\user\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`
